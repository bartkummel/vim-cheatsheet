# VIM cheat sheet

Since there are a lot of VIM cheat sheets already, I thought: 'why not adding another one'? ;-)

There are [many](http://michael.peopleofhonoronly.com/vim/) [cheat](http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html) [sheets](http://sheet.shiar.nl/vi) that use the keyboard layout as starting point, but to me, that works in the wrong direction. I also found [this one](https://external-preview.redd.it/iigrixvxp5aYN9ox7Gr1dfI_rhLRotWlLsCafjJqjEQ.png?auto=webp&s=1594ddc17408cb9186a73c2a6d1a1bf1e00769dd), which does a nice job displaying certain aspects graphically. Unfortunately it's not open source and the [official website](http://www.vimcheatsheet.com/) seems to be down. And, to be honest, I think there's a bit too much information in that one. For me at least.

So, I ended up creating my own cheat sheet. Design goals are:

- Clearly categorized, so that I can find keys by topic;
- Taking the desired action as starting point, instead of the keyboard layout;
- Giving clues how to remember keys;
- Being clean and easy on the eyes;
- Only cover the basics: otherwise there will be too much information on a small sheet;
- Being printable on a single A4 sized paper; 
- Last but not least: being open source.

And here's the result so far: [VIM cheat sheet](cheatsheet.png)

## Contributing

Please, feel free to contibute! I'm open for PR's, you could also create a Github issue to suggest improvements. A few things to keep in mind:

- I've created the SVG's with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), an open source vector drawing program. I think the best results can be get by using the same tool, if you want to contribute.
- I've created separate files for each section and imported the sections into the `cheatsheet.svg` file. This seemed a good solution when I started, but I see some downsides too. So I'm open for suggestions how to better organise things.
